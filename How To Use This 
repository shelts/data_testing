here you will find multiple linked programs which gives stats about output data.

the bash script stat_plots.sh will take the output files from the nbody_test/bin/output.out and parse it into light matter and dark matter data.

it does so with the python script to parse it. 

the python script outputs them into /raw_data
the output_test.cpp program does math on that data. all binned data does in /binned_data 


gnuplot script plots the binned data. 

the bash script then makes a new folder and moves these into there and makes new directories to prepare for another run. 




The stability test:
this bash script will take 5 outputs, at 0gy, 1gy, 2gy, 3gy, and 4gy, do the stats on it and plot each so the stability of each component can be seen over time.

this script can also be called from the stability run script one folder above. That script compiles, and runs the sim 5 times, producing the outputs required and then does the histograms.
